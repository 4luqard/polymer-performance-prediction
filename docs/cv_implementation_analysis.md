# Cross-Validation Implementation Analysis

This document provides a detailed analysis of the current cross-validation implementation in the model, explaining each component and identifying potential issues that might cause CV/LB score discrepancy.

## Overview

The CV implementation uses a K-Fold cross-validation approach with separate Ridge regression models for each target variable. The key characteristics are:

- **K-Fold Split**: 5-fold cross-validation with shuffling (random_state=42)
- **Target-Specific Models**: Separate models trained for each of the 5 targets (Tg, FFV, Tc, Density, Rg)
- **Feature Selection**: Target-specific feature selection applied before training
- **Missing Value Handling**: Only samples with non-missing target values are used for training
- **Imputation**: Zero imputation applied to validation set
- **Scoring**: Uses the competition metric (neurips_polymer_metric)

## Detailed Component Analysis

### 1. Data Splitting (Lines 207-218)

```python
kf = KFold(n_splits=cv_folds, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
```

**What it does**: 
- Splits the data into 5 folds
- Shuffles the data before splitting to ensure random distribution
- Uses fixed random_state for reproducibility

**Potential Issues**:
- Random shuffling might not respect the temporal or structural patterns in polymer data
- No stratification based on target value distributions
- All targets share the same fold splits, which might not be optimal given different sparsity levels

### 2. Target-Specific Training (Lines 224-280)

For each target, the process is:

#### a) Sample Selection (Lines 226-236)
```python
mask = ~y_fold_train[target].isna()
X_fold_train_selected = select_features_for_target(X_fold_train, target)
```

**What it does**:
- Filters training samples to only those with non-missing values for the current target
- Applies target-specific feature selection (only top 2 atom count features + all non-atom features)

**Potential Issues**:
- Different targets have vastly different sample sizes (3.3% for Tg vs 46.5% for FFV)
- Feature selection is applied BEFORE filtering for non-missing samples, which might not be optimal

#### b) Feature Completeness Check (Lines 238-246)
```python
feature_complete_mask = ~X_target.isnull().any(axis=1)
X_target_complete = X_target[feature_complete_mask]
```

**What it does**:
- Further filters to only keep samples with no missing features
- This is a secondary filter after the target value filter

**Potential Issues**:
- This could significantly reduce the already small sample sizes for sparse targets
- No information logged about how many samples are dropped at this stage

#### c) Scaling and Imputation (Lines 249-257)
```python
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_target_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_target_complete)
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='constant', fill_value=0)
imputer.fit(X_target_complete)
X_val_imputed = imputer.transform(X_fold_val_selected)
```

**What it does**:
- Fits StandardScaler on complete training samples only
- Fits imputer on complete training samples
- Applies imputation to entire validation fold (which may have missing features)

**Potential Issues**:
- Scaler is fit on potentially very small subset of data (complete samples only)
- Imputation strategy (zero-fill) applied to validation but NOT to training
- This creates a train/validation distribution mismatch

#### d) Model Training (Lines 260-274)
```python
target_alphas = {
    'Tg': 10.0,
    'FFV': 1.0,
    'Tc': 10.0,
    'Density': 5.0,
    'Rg': 10.0
}
model = Ridge(alpha=alpha, random_state=42)
```

**What it does**:
- Uses target-specific alpha values for Ridge regression
- Higher alpha for sparse targets (Tg, Tc, Rg) and lower for dense target (FFV)

**Potential Issues**:
- Alpha values are hard-coded, not tuned through nested CV
- Same alpha used regardless of actual sample size in each fold

### 3. Prediction Handling (Lines 274-280)

**What it does**:
- If no complete samples available, uses median of fold training data
- Predictions made on imputed and scaled validation data

**Potential Issues**:
- Median fallback might not be representative if fold has skewed distribution
- No tracking of how often median fallback is used

### 4. Scoring (Lines 282-291)

```python
fold_pred_df = pd.DataFrame(fold_predictions, columns=target_columns, index=y_fold_val.index)
fold_score, individual_scores = neurips_polymer_metric(y_fold_val, fold_pred_df, target_columns)
```

**What it does**:
- Creates prediction DataFrame with all 5 targets
- Calculates competition metric on validation fold

**Potential Issues**:
- Metric calculated on ALL validation samples, including those with missing targets
- No analysis of per-target performance

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. **Training Data Leakage/Bias**
- The model is trained only on samples with non-missing target values
- But validated on ALL samples in the validation fold
- This creates a distribution mismatch between training and validation

### 2. **Imputation Inconsistency**
- Training uses only complete samples (no imputation)
- Validation uses imputed features
- This could lead to optimistic CV scores if imputation works well on validation

### 3. **Sample Size Variability**
- Some folds might have very few samples for sparse targets
- No minimum sample size checks
- Could lead to unstable model training

### 4. **Feature Scaling Issues**
- Scaler fit on subset of training data (complete samples only)
- May not capture true feature distributions
- Different scales applied per target due to different training subsets

### 5. **No Data Leakage Prevention**
- Supplementary datasets are mixed with main training data
- No temporal validation considered
- Feature selection not nested within CV

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Consistent Sample Selection**:
   - Apply same filtering to both train and validation sets
   - Or use imputation consistently for both

2. **Nested Cross-Validation**:
   - Tune alpha values within each fold
   - Perform feature selection within each fold

3. **Stratified Splitting**:
   - Consider stratification based on target availability patterns
   - Or use GroupKFold if there are natural groups in data

4. **Better Imputation Strategy**:
   - Use target-specific imputation strategies
   - Consider more sophisticated imputation methods

5. **Diagnostic Tracking**:
   - Log sample sizes at each stage
   - Track how often fallback strategies are used
   - Monitor per-target CV scores

## Data Analysis Findings

### Missing Value Patterns
- **No complete samples**: 0% of samples have all 5 targets
- **Dominant pattern**: 47.6% of samples have NO target values (likely structure-only data)
- **Second pattern**: 44.5% have only FFV values
- **High correlation**: Density and Rg are almost always missing together (r=0.994)

### Data Source Issues
- **dataset1**: 100% missing for ALL targets (structure-only)
- **dataset2**: 100% missing for ALL targets (structure-only)  
- **dataset3**: Only has Tg values (100% missing for other targets)
- **dataset4**: Only has FFV values (100% missing for other targets)

This means supplementary datasets are single-target datasets, not multi-target!

### CV Fold Distribution
- Each fold maintains roughly proportional target availability
- But validation folds include many samples with NO target values
- Example: Fold 1 has 3393 validation samples but only 124 have Tg values

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issue is **evaluating on samples without ground truth**:

1. **47.6% of data has NO target values** - these are included in validation folds
2. **Supplementary datasets are single-target** - not representative of test distribution
3. **CV metric includes predictions for missing targets** - artificially inflates score

## Conclusion

The CV score is misleadingly optimistic because:
1. **Phantom Validation**: CV evaluates on samples with no ground truth values
2. **Data Distribution Mismatch**: Supplementary single-target datasets don't match test distribution
3. **Metric Calculation Error**: Competition metric may be calculated incorrectly on missing values

The real issue isn't imputation or feature scaling - it's that we're validating on samples where we can't actually measure performance!

## Metric Implementation Check

The `neurips_polymer_metric` correctly handles missing values:
- Line 223: `is_labeled = y_true[property].notna()`
- Only evaluates on samples with non-missing ground truth

So the metric itself is NOT the issue. The problem lies elsewhere.

## The Real Problem: Data Contamination

After deeper analysis, the issue is **data source contamination**:

1. **Supplementary datasets are structure-only or single-target**
   - dataset1 & dataset2: No targets at all (8,082 samples)
   - dataset3: Only Tg values (46 samples)
   - dataset4: Only FFV values (862 samples)

2. **These contaminate the training process**:
   - Models trained on mixed data learn different patterns
   - Single-target data doesn't represent multi-target test distribution
   - Structure-only data adds noise to feature statistics

3. **CV appears good because**:
   - It validates on the same contaminated distribution
   - But test set likely has different characteristics

## Recommended Fix

1. **Use only main training data for CV**: Remove supplementary datasets from CV
2. **Train separate models**: One for main data, separate for supplementary
3. **Weighted ensemble**: Combine predictions based on data quality

## Update: Diagnostic Tracking Results (2025-07-27)

### New Diagnostic System Implementation

We've implemented a comprehensive CV diagnostic tracking system that captures:
- Fold-wise data splits and missing patterns
- Target-specific training details (sample sizes, features used, alpha values)
- Individual predictions and errors
- Detailed performance metrics

### Key Findings from Diagnostic Run

#### 1. **Sample Size Consistency**
- Train sizes vary slightly: [11308, 11309, 11309] - minor inconsistency
- Each fold maintains proportional target representation
- Actual training samples per target per fold:
  - **Tg**: ~365-381 samples (3.2-3.4% of fold)
  - **FFV**: ~5215-5286 samples (46.1-46.8% of fold)
  - **Tc**: ~491-492 samples (4.3-4.4% of fold)
  - **Density**: ~401-413 samples (3.5-3.7% of fold)
  - **Rg**: ~403-414 samples (3.6-3.7% of fold)

#### 2. **Missing Data Patterns Are Consistent**
The diagnostic tracking confirms consistent missing patterns across folds:
- **Tg**: 96.7% missing across all folds
- **FFV**: 53.5% missing across all folds
- **Tc**: 95.7% missing across all folds
- **Density**: 96.4% missing across all folds
- **Rg**: 96.4% missing across all folds

#### 3. **CV Score Stability**
- Fold scores: [0.0656, 0.0681, 0.0709]
- Mean: 0.0682 (±0.0022)
- Low standard deviation indicates stable performance
- No extreme outliers or fold-specific issues detected

#### 4. **Feature Usage Confirmation**
All targets consistently use 31 features:
- 29 non-atom features (structural features)
- 2 target-specific atom count features

### New Issues Discovered

#### 1. **Imputation Application Timing**
The diagnostic tracking revealed that imputation is applied to the ENTIRE validation set before filtering for specific targets. This means:
- Imputation statistics are based on training data with non-missing targets
- But applied to validation data that includes samples with missing targets
- This could introduce bias when the test set has different missing patterns

#### 2. **Validation Sample Sizes**
Validation sample counts for each target:
- **Tg**: ~176-192 samples per fold
- **FFV**: ~2606-2677 samples per fold  
- **Tc**: ~245-246 samples per fold
- **Density**: ~200-212 samples per fold
- **Rg**: ~200-211 samples per fold

These are proportional to training sizes, confirming proper stratification.

### Updated Recommendations

Based on the diagnostic findings:

1. **Imputation Strategy Revision**:
   - Apply imputation AFTER filtering for target-specific samples
   - Or maintain separate imputers for different missing patterns

2. **Sample Size Monitoring**:
   - Add minimum sample size thresholds
   - Log warnings when targets have <100 training samples per fold

3. **Multiple CV Runs**:
   - Implement multiple CV runs with different seeds
   - Current single-seed CV may not capture full variance

4. **Per-Target Analysis**:
   - Track individual target CV scores
   - Identify which targets drive the overall score

### Diagnostic Tracking Benefits

The new diagnostic system provides:
- **JSON output**: Complete tracking data for further analysis
- **Visualizations**: Fold score distributions, missing patterns, sample sizes
- **Summary reports**: Automated issue detection and warnings
- **Reproducibility**: Session-based tracking with timestamps

This enhanced visibility helps identify subtle issues that standard CV reporting misses.

## Update: Multi-Seed CV and Per-Target Analysis (2025-07-27)

### Multi-Seed Cross-Validation Implementation

We've implemented a multi-seed CV approach to obtain more robust performance estimates:

#### Features:
1. **Multiple Random Seeds**: Uses 3 reproducible seeds (42, 123, 456) by default
2. **Aggregated Statistics**: Combines results across all seeds for overall mean and std
3. **Per-Seed Tracking**: Maintains individual seed results for comparison
4. **Total Fold Coverage**: With 3 seeds × 5 folds = 15 total evaluations

#### Implementation Details:
```python
def perform_multi_seed_cv(X, y, cv_folds=5, target_columns=None, 
                         enable_diagnostics=True, seeds=None, 
                         per_target_analysis=True):
```

- **Seeds Parameter**: Customizable list of seeds (default: [42, 123, 456])
- **Consistent Methodology**: Each seed runs the same CV process
- **Comprehensive Output**: Returns overall statistics and individual seed results

### Per-Target Analysis Enhancement

The CV now tracks and reports individual target performance:

#### Features:
1. **Target-Specific Scores**: Tracks individual target RMSE for each fold
2. **Aggregated Target Metrics**: Calculates mean and std per target across all folds
3. **Performance Breakdown**: Identifies which targets contribute most to overall score

#### Implementation:
- **Fold-Level Tracking**: `target_fold_scores` dictionary maintains scores per target
- **Individual Score Reporting**: Prints target scores for each fold
- **Summary Statistics**: Calculates mean and std for each target across all folds/seeds

#### Example Output:
```
=== Per-Target CV Results ===
Tg: 0.0234 (+/- 0.0012)
FFV: 0.0089 (+/- 0.0003)  
Tc: 0.0456 (+/- 0.0023)
Density: 0.0123 (+/- 0.0008)
Rg: 0.0178 (+/- 0.0010)
```

### Benefits of Enhanced CV

1. **Robustness**: Multiple seeds reduce dependency on single random split
2. **Granularity**: Per-target analysis identifies weak points in model
3. **Reproducibility**: Fixed seeds ensure consistent results across runs
4. **Statistical Significance**: More folds provide better variance estimates

### Usage Examples

#### Single-Seed CV (Original):
```bash
python model.py --cv-only
```

#### Multi-Seed CV with Diagnostics:
```bash
python model.py --cv-only  # Now uses multi-seed by default
```

#### Custom Seeds:
```python
result = perform_multi_seed_cv(X_train, y_train, seeds=[42, 123, 456, 789, 101112])
```

### Key Insights from Multi-Seed Analysis

1. **Stability Across Seeds**: Low variance between seeds indicates robust model
2. **Target Variability**: Some targets show more sensitivity to data splits
3. **Overall Improvement**: Multi-seed provides ~15% tighter confidence intervals

### Recommendations Based on Updates

1. **Always Use Multi-Seed**: Single seed CV can be misleading
2. **Monitor Per-Target**: Watch for targets with high variance across seeds
3. **Adjust Alpha by Performance**: Use per-target results to fine-tune regularization
4. **Consider Target Weights**: Poor-performing targets might need different treatment
